# Extracting Words corpus from WordNet Using NLTK
This python script use to extract words from WORDNET using Python Natural language Processing Toolkit dictionary .Script extract almost 3 lac words and save in CSV file. 

## [WORDNET](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)
WordNetÂ® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.

## [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)

It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.
